Warren4 was formed by Richard Warren in 2019 as an independent consultancy aimed at providing the hightest level of support to companies looking to deploy, upgrade and migrate information managements solutions.

## Knowing how to deliver

Having spent many years at the coal face as a Technical Engineer and Solution Architect, Richard knew what it meant to deliver solutions that not only work, but deliver true value. Working in some of the most challenging environments within highly regulated and security constrained industries gave Richard an almost unique skill set which is core to the Warren4 services.

## Product and industry experience

Richard moved from projects to products, taking the lead as Product Manager for a well established solution as they pivoted to the cloud.  With this came a deep understanding of SaaS, mobile and the art of Product Management. From Product Owner to Director of Product Management, Richard took the ethos and understanding of delivering value and built the teams, processes and products to succeed.
