Many industries and companies believe they are unique - and in some cases that may be true. However, in our experience even seemingly very different industries actually have many of the same problems.

## Same problems, different terminology
It is common to have industry specific terminology but at the core there is are common pains.  More enlightened companies know this already and are actively looking to standardize, use OOTB (out of the box) solutions to save costs now and for the life of the solution.  If you plan to adopt SaaS solutions then the success of that will depend on you having this understanding and embracing it!
