## Understand what success looks like

In his legendary 'We choose to go to the moon' speech, President Kennedy did something rarely seen in many endeavors - he set a clear goal.

It's where the term 'moonshot' has derived - a goal so lofty that it seems almost impossible. But it wasn't. It was clearly and simply defined with a definitive outcome and timeframe. This was instrumental in making the moon landings a success as everyone involved knew where they were heading, why and how long they had to do it.

## Plan accordingly

Projects typically start out with estimations on how long each task will take constrained by the available resources.  Getting this right can be the difference between success and failure. Under estimate and it will always be late and over budget - not always through the fault of the project team, but because an impossible bar had already been set.

Over-estimate and the team can loose focus and momentum, the dreaded scope creep is there to fill (and then overfill) the available time and resources.

If you start with your eyes open - with an experienced project team who have the skills and motivation to make it a success, a clear understanding of the measures of success and how they can be achieved, only then are you on the path to success.

Warren4 can help you at every stage of the project lifecycle:

1. **Initiation** - setting clear goals and defining what success looks like.  Ensuring we know what resources are needed.
2. **Collaboration** - selection and provision of tools to ensure the team is effective.  The project tools should be there to enhance the team - not be a chore and slow down progress.
3. **Change Management** - don't be fooled into thinking that because you are following waterfall methodology and have specified every inch of the solution, that there won't be changes.  Expect and and plan for it - get a process in place at the very beginning that deals with change in an open and clear way for all project stakeholders.  Warren4 can show you how to remove the pain of unplanned changes and embrace them as improvements to the outcome.
4. **Release Management** - just because you went live with your shiny new solution don't be fooled into thinking that you are done. It's just the beginning! You want your solution to adapt to your business and your business adapts to the fast changing world.  Disruption is the game and being able to pivot at short notice is the only way to survive.  Warren4 can help you embed agile practices from the beginning to ensure that you don't get stuck in the past and your investment continues to work as needed.
5. **Quality Assurance** - as with all of the above, if you start well it will pay dividends for the life of the solution.  Even with legacy solutions it is possible to bring agile and automated testing practices to level-up the quality of the outcome.  Warren4 can help you roll-out to your users with confidence that the solution is truly ready.
