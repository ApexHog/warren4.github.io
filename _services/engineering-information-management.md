Engineering Information Management is a specialist area of document and information management required by **process industries, facilities management and all types of discreet and industrial engineering**.

# Not all EDMS are the same 

It is common to see generic document management software being promoted as solutions for engineering information.  Typically this fails to meet the needs of the creators and consumers of this type of information - this is due to the following factors that are not natively supported:

1. Engineering documents are more that just documents - they contain detailed and valuable information that is critical to the delivery and operation of assets
2. Revisions and versions are not the same thing, neither are document types and asset classification
3. Renditions of source data are required throughout the document and asset lifecycle so consumers can use the information without the need for expensive CAD software - the renditions and source data need to be managed as one interchangeable entity
4. Data volumes can be very large and need a robust back-end to cope and a UI that works with large data sets
