I"å<h1>hello world!</h1>

<p>My name is Richard Warren, and Warren 4 is my company. Warren 4 was originally the domain name I registered for my familyâ€™s email accounts as I didnâ€™t like advertising companies with my email address! For a few pounds a year I get an internet personalised number plate - why not?! When I formed my latest company I decided to use this name as this reflects the personal nature of what I plan to do.</p>

<p>First and foremost, I am here to learn, offer advice and prattle on about anything that I think is worthy of sharing. My expertise is in helping people to implement complex software tools that deliver some sort of value. Value is key - why do it at all otherwise? Value can come in many guises - primarily you want to see that things (anything) are better by using a tool; a problem has been solved or reduced. Does that added value warrant the investment of time and money? Is that value immediate or over time? How do you keep the value or increase it?</p>
