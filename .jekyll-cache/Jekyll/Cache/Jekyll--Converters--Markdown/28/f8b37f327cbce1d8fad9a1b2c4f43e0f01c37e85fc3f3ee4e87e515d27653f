I"’<p>I typically try to have two sets of tools - one for work life and the other for home life.  Mixing the two can be problematic and increase stress as it can be difficult to switch off.  Particularly if you haven‚Äôt yet figured out that email notifications are one of the most evil and disruptive pieces of tech ever invented - if you have email notifications turned on, go and turn them off now. Seriously, do it now, you‚Äôll thank me later.</p>

<p>Ok, so you‚Äôre back after turning off your email notifications.  You have just reduced your stress as much as a 10 week course on meditation - it was that easy!  So what about other notifications?  This is where it gets a bit sketchy - sometimes you need them. Especially if you are anything like me who goes into a parallel universe when concentrating on something.  Nothing this side of a slap in the face with a wet fish will snap me out of it. I also have a problem with gravity and my bottom lip when I‚Äôm ‚Äòin the zone‚Äô much to the entertainment of my family, but that‚Äôs another story.</p>

<p>I have a problem with doing deep work AND being on time.  Like John Cleese said ‚Äúcreativity does not tollerate time pressure‚Äù.  To really get the best out of yourself for the task at hand it really is better to give it your full attention.  If you are constantly thinking about what‚Äôs next or ‚Äòmulitasking‚Äô, you really are limiting your creative capabilities. The problem is that life is complicated - we have families, pets and other responsibilities that mean we have to stop what we are doing and move onto something else.  This is where I have a problem with the current state of notifications.</p>

<p>I like my tech, so the choice of where my notifications come from is manifold - they come through a whole host of channels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mobile phone</li>
  <li>smart watch</li>
  <li>smart speaker</li>
  <li>land line</li>
  <li>cooker</li>
  <li>washing machine</li>
  <li>fire alarm</li>
  <li>Pepper the dog</li>
</ul>
