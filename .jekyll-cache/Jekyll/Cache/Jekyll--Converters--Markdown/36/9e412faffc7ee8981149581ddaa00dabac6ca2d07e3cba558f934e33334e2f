I"Â<p>I typically try to have two sets of tools - one for work life and the other for home life.  Mixing the two can be problematic and increase stress as it can be difficult to switch off.  Particularly if you havenâ€™t yet figured out that email notifications are one of the most evil and disruptive pieces of tech ever invented - if you have email notifications turned on, go and turn them off now. Seriously, do it now, youâ€™ll thank me later.</p>
