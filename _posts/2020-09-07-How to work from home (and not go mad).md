As we go through these tough times with many people now having to work from home for the first time, I thought I would share my tips from my journey and experience of remote working from the past 10+ years that may be of benefit to others. These are the most important things that have saved my sanity and health! I learned the hard way so you don't have to.

# Create a Start-up and Shutdown process 
I pack my bag as if I am leaving the house. I shower and dress for work (although it's a bit more relaxed than normal but also important later!). I try to build good habits one at a time - like drinking a glass of water right after getting up and building a meditation habit (very useful right now!). At the end of the day, I finish up with a shut-down routine, pack my laptop away, clear my desk and commute the few steps back to my family and am fully present with them. I use [Todoist](https://todoist.com/r/richard_warren_pajosf) to remind myself of these little things by creating a set of repeating tasks and applying the [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) method.

# Try to have a workspace that is just for work.
This can be difficult if you don't do this normally. Try to keep personal and work separate. It can help reduce distraction and procrastination. Don't use your personal computer if you already have a work laptop. One additional thing you can do, which works surprisingly well, is to have some ambient sound - I use [A Soft Murmur](https://asoftmurmur.com/) with the sounds of a cafe.

# Cabin fever is real
This is probably the most important thing. Make sure you talk to others regularly. Use cameras too when using Zoom, Webex, Skype, Teams or Facetime (that's why we got dressed properly - working in your underwear doesn't work so well!) - seeing the person you are talking to is so much better for clear communication. Paranoia and anxiety fester if you keep to yourself - things are always better when we keep talking!

# Stand-up and move. Regularly. 
I found I can literally sit all day if I have some deep work to do. Go make a cup of tea/coffee. I let my teabag stew for 5 minutes (it's the best way, scientifically proven to get the best from the tea) and then do a 5-minute workout whilst I'm waiting in the kitchen (as recommended by Dr Chatterjee). I do a minute each of squats, calf raises, lunges, press-ups and dips on a chair - you can do any exercise or movement you like. Just make it easy to do here and now. No equipment or change of clothes required. If you did this even just once a day you'd be amazed at how your body reacts. 

Follow at least one of these tips and I guarantee it will help. Do them all and you will be flying and maybe actually enjoying it. Think of this as an opportunity to come out of this better than when you started.

I hope that you find something useful from here. If you want more tips, I have lots more where this came from - just ask.

Stay well!
